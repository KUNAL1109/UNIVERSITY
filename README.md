The code is designed to encrypt and decrypt a message using RSA encryption method. 
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm.
This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. 
The other key must be kept private.
